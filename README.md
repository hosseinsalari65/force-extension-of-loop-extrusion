# Polymer Simulation of Force-Dependent Loop-Extrusion
## Overview
This code simulates the force-dependent loop-extrusion process of Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes on a polymer chain. It models how loop extruding factors (LEFs) interact with chromatin under external force, accounting for processivity, binding, extrusion rates, and directionality.

The simulation outputs the end-to-end vector of the polymer, which can be used to study conformational changes under varying mechanical and extrusion conditions.
